## PyCharm
To run the bot directly from PyCharm you get set the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable to the bot token in the run configuration.
## Deployment to Heroku
Push directly to Heroku with git see [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#create-a-heroku-remote). 
Make sure the bot token environment variable is set in the heroku settings or with the heroku CLI.
